# Machine Learning - Predict Staffing Need of Mental Health Counselors for Centura Health

Using regressive analysis with machine learning, this project aimed to determine the time of day that is needed for the highest staffing needs for each hospital location, including a breakdown of each day of the week.

- Using 7 months of staffing CSV's that required cleaning and converting of data to properly use predictive analysis

- Once the data was clean, it was put into regressive statement and visulization of the data

- Now the data was used to show the accuracy of the regression

## Conclusion
- The prediciton accuracy is low, and more dimensions (such as demographic information and weather) are needed to more accurately predict staffing needs
- The graphs in the Ultra Clean Jupyter Notebook indicate that there are spikes of staffing needs between 5:00 am and 7:00 am, and again between 1:00pm and 3:00 pm.
